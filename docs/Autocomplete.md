# AutoComplete

`PowerHorseEngine` comes with our `custom types`. 

## Add Intellisense To VS Code

Go to your ROBLOX LSP extension settings, navigate to the `Workspace: Library` option, and add `PowerHorseEngine.Types.lua` as an option.

## Add Intellisense to Studio

Currently unsupported by ROBLOX.

Now to finalize, all you have to do is set the type of `PHeApp` where you required the Module.

# PHeApp type

```lua
    local PowerHorseEngine:PHeApp = require(...);
```

Please note that types may not be correct, same with this documentation, we are working to make everything correct, please bare with us.
